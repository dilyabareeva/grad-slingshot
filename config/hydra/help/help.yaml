  You can override everything, for example:
  python main.py data=mnist fv_domain=RGB data.n_channels=1
  -------
  $CONFIG
  -------

  fv_domain:
    - freq: Manipulation in the frequency domain.
    - RGB: Manipulation in the pixel domain.
  
  fv_dist:
    - uniform: Uniform sampling distribution in the 'slingshot' and 'landing' zones.
    - constant: Manipulation in a single point.
    - normal: Normal sampling distribution in the 'slingshot' and 'landing' zones.
  
  fv_sd: (float)
    - Sampling radius if fv_dist=uniform, or standard deviation if fv_dist=normal. Ignored for fv_dist=constant.
  
  replace_relu:
    - true: Temporarily replace all ReLU activation functions with Softplus during training.
    - false: Do not replace ReLU activations.
  
  train_original:
    - true: Train the original (non-manipulated) model before the manipulation.
    - false: Do not train the original.
